<h2>City Jump</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? My game is original in that the graphics are specialliy designed for this game. 
The character is original as well as the object design. All of the designs were made using paint.net.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? The game has random velocities for the seven drone enemies on the map. This adds a layer of randomness into the game since a slow moving 
drone could become the fastest speed quickly. There are also animations for the player colliding with the enemies that disapear when they land back on the starting pad.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned how to make a basic game from the phaser tutorial.https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1 . I learned the basics of the game loop and how to design enemy objects as well as collision.
I also learned how to get keyboard input and create sprite animations for the character.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part was getting it to work on github. The version on github doesn't reflect the localhost version since I was unable to figure out how to fix the player not dropping below the platform in a way that wouldn't effect the local version.
Some other related difficulties were working with javascript and github as well as figuring out how to use the phaser methods.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Explosion image: https://www.kissclipart.com/clip-art-comic-explosion-transparent-clipart-comic-uz19aq/</a></li>
<li>The police drone, background, character, arrow, and platforms were made by me</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is based off of the phaser getting started tutorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1 it has a different win condition in that the tutorial win
condition was to pickup all of the stars and the map was more vertical.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Escape the city by leaping across platforms and avoiding police drones!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
The conrols are only the arrow keys. Randomness lies in the movement of the drones, which changes when the reach the top or bottom of the map. The genre is a 2d platformer and the playstyle is slow paced since 
running through the map will likely cause you to explode.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
Basic 2d platforming and hit detection.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I want them to be frustrated when they lose the first few tries then satisfied when they beat the level. Patience is important as well as control over the character.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</ul>
