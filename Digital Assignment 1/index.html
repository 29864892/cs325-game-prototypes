<h2>City Jump</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is original in that the graphics are specialliy designed for this game. 
The character is original as well as the object design. All of the designs were made using paint.net.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? The game has random velocities for the seven drone enemies on the map. This adds a layer of randomness into the game since a slow moving 
drone could become the fastest speed quickly. There are also animations for the player colliding with the enemies that disapear when they land back on the starting pad.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to make a basic game from the phaser tutorial.https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1 . I learned the basics of the game loop and how to design enemy objects as well as collision.
I also learned how to get keyboard input and create sprite animations for the character.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part was getting it to work on github. The version on github doesn't reflect the localhost version since I was unable to figure out how to fix the player not dropping below the platform in a way that wouldn't effect the local version.
Some other related difficulties were working with javascript and github as well as figuring out how to use the phaser methods. Another hard part was the constraint of space since I kept it to one instance.

<li>The police drone, background, character, arrow, and platforms were made by me</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is based off of the phaser getting started tutorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1 it has a different win condition in that the tutorial win
condition was to pickup all of the stars and the map was more vertical.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Escape the city by leaping across platforms and avoiding police drones!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The conrols are only the arrow keys. Randomness lies in the movement of the drones, which changes when the reach the top or bottom of the map. The genre is a 2d platformer and the playstyle is slow paced since 
running through the map will likely cause you to explode.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Basic 2d platforming and hit detection, as well as running, jumping and the associated mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to be frustrated when they lose the first few tries then satisfied when they beat the level. Patience is important as well as control over the character.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
 Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
In this game, players can run across the map. The core mechanic is jumping past the drones, which is made more difficult by the randomness of the drones' velocities. The controls are the 
arrow keys which move the character left, right, or up. The platforms are spaced in a way that makes them easy to reach so the main interference with reaching the end lies in
the enemies. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
An effective strategy is to be patient and wait for each drone to roll the lowest speed and then move. An intial and likely less effective strategy would be to
attempt to rush through the level, but this will likely cause the player to die if they are not experienced in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The game is set in a futuristic world where ai are prevalent. The player wakes up and realizes that they are no longer in their own body and are now wanted by the police.
To catch the player for reasons yet unknown, the government has deployed police drones across the city. However, these cheap drones are easily avoided if the player is careful. 
In search of the truth, the player attempts to escape the city, jumping across ledges and evading the police in hopes of finding an answer.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual 2d platformer players.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Play time can vary greatly by player. It is possible to clear the level in less than a minute if the player is lucky or skilled enough. It may take longer if the player uses all
3 of their lives or if they take their time at each drone.
</li>
