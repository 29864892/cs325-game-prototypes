<h2>Space Fighter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
All of the art was created by myself through paint.net.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There are two types of enemies with different movement patterns. The debris can move in the y direction while the enemies only move forward. There are also projectiles that collide with both
the enemies and the debris which scores 100 and 50 points respectively. Each time an enemy is hit, all enemies gain a permanent speed boost as well to raise the difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned how to make groups of enemies as well as projectiles. I also learned how to lower the volume of sounds and how to add a tutorial at the start of the game. I also learned how toimplement timers
to make the code function better.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part was the projectiles because there is a bug in the game where shooting a missle the moment the enemy is hit creates a motionless object that stays on the screen. I was unable to
figure out how to fix it so I simply removed the projectile limit which may cause the program to crash if it goes on for too long.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>debris object, enemy, lazer, space background and player ship were made by me.</ul>
<ul> Explosion sound from https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/350978/ </ul>
<ul> game music from https://patrickdearteaga.com/arcade-music/ </ul>
<ul> weapon sound from https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/laser-235 </ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
