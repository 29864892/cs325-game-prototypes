<h2>Space Fighter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
All of the art was created by myself through paint.net.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There are two types of enemies with different movement patterns. The debris can move in the y direction while the enemies only move forward. There are also projectiles that collide with both
the enemies and the debris which scores 100 and 50 points respectively. Each time an enemy is hit, all enemies gain a permanent speed boost as well to raise the difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned how to make groups of enemies as well as projectiles. I also learned how to lower the volume of sounds and how to add a tutorial at the start of the game. I also learned how toimplement timers
to make the code function better.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part was the projectiles because there is a bug in the game where shooting a missle the moment the enemy is hit creates a motionless object that stays on the screen. I was unable to
figure out how to fix it so I simply removed the projectile limit which may cause the program to crash if it goes on for too long.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>debris object, enemy, lazer, space background and player ship were made by me.</ul>
<ul> Explosion sound from https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/350978/ </ul>
<ul> game music from https://patrickdearteaga.com/arcade-music/ </ul>
<ul> weapon sound from https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/laser-235 </ul>
<li></a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game is based off of my last game with modifications made to the player objects and the player movement with entirely new assets.
Portions of code were taken from tutorial sites for iteration in groups as well as the timer, which is cited within the comments.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fight enemy ships and space junk as you travel through space in a frantic fight for survival.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Flight.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game uses keyboard controls with direct input. There is also randomness in enemy spawns and movement.
Additionally, the play style is competitor since there is a score tracker. The genre is shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Prototype a space shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should learn how to be comfortable with the controls and become good at dodging the projectiles
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
In theory, one could only shoot the debris for less points but the difficulty would never increase. Shooting the enemies gives more points but makes the game harder. 
Another strategy is to shoot whatever is in front of you and try to survive as long as possible. The controls are simple: the arrow keys are used to movev and the s button is used to fire.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In the game, the player is fleeing after the space armada they were a part of was decimated in a decisive battle. Now they must flee the swarm of enemies that remain while also
avoiding the remains of their allies' ships. As they defeat more enemies, the enemies become enraged and continue to pursue the player, determined to wipe out their foe for good.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players that enjoy fast paced space shooters.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The quickest is about 20 seconds assuming the player dies right after each phase of invulnerability. The game could in theory last forever if the player never shoots since 
the objects are easy to dodge.
